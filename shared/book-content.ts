        content: `You are here.

And that means something.

This book is not just a collection of words.
It is a place to rest. A place to feel.
A place where your heart will be spoken to
In ways you didn't know it needed.

It is a journey—one you do not have to rush through.
One you do not have to be ready for.

Let this book meet you exactly where you are.
Let it unfold in your hands like a quiet revelation,
Like something you have always known but never had the words for.

Because that is what words do.
They name the feelings we thought were nameless.
They light candles in the rooms we thought would always be dark.

This book is for the ones who feel too much.
For the ones who have held on for too long.
For the ones who do not know how to let go,
But are learning.

For the ones who have loved deeply,
Who have ached quietly,
Who have searched for meaning in the spaces
Where silence lingers.

You will find yourself in these pages.
Not because they will tell you who to be—
but because they will remind you of who you have always been.

Let this book be a mirror.
Let it be a hand on your back, a whisper in your ear.
Let it be a place where you no longer have to explain yourself.
Where you do not have to beg to be understood.

This is not just a book.
This is a beginning.
And I promise you—
It is a beautiful one.`

        content: `You Are a Poem, and the World is Reading You

You did not find this book by accident. It found you.

Somewhere between the pages, between the spaces of each word, there is a reflection of you. This is not just a book—it is a mirror, a conversation, a quiet whisper in the spaces you thought no one noticed.

It Is here to sit with you in your softness, to unravel you gently, to remind you that you have always been poetry in motion. It will ask you questions you didn't know you needed to answer. It will pull at the threads of your heart, not to unravel you completely, but to show you the beauty of being woven together, even after everything.

This book is not here to teach you who you are. It is here to remind you of what you already know—of the love that has shaped you, the pain that has strengthened you, and the art of being human in all its aching, beautiful forms.

You are a poem. And the world is reading you.

–Zeke Iverson.`

Not meant to be a passing storm
That rages and disappears,
Leaving wreckage in its wake.

Love is the steady rain
That softens the earth,
The quiet presence
That does not demand to be seen
Yet is always felt.

Love is not just passion.
It is presence.

It is choosing—
Day after day,
Moment after moment,
To stay.

Even when the fire of newness fades,
Even when life grows heavy,
Even when the road is long
And uncertain.

Love is the hand
That reaches for yours in the dark.
The voice that says,
"You do not have to walk alone."

It is not perfect,
But it does not leave.
It does not break at the first sign of struggle.
It does not retreat when the world becomes too much.

Love stays.
Even when it is quiet.
Even when it is not easy.
Even when it has to be chosen,
Again and again.

Because love,
True love,
Is not just about feeling.
It is about being.

And it is steady,
Even when everything else is not.`

        content: `Love should never be a half-written story,
A hesitation,
A feeling that lingers in the air
But never lands.

You deserve a love
That does not flinch when the world gets heavy.
A love that does not step back
When the waters rise.
A love that does not make you wonder
If you are enough.

Because love—real love—chooses.

It chooses you in the morning light,
When your hair is messy
And your eyes are still full of dreams.
It chooses you in the midnight silence,
When your fears slip between the sheets like shadows.
It chooses you on the easy days and the impossible ones,
Not because it has to,
But because it cannot imagine a world where it does not.

Love is not meant to be guessed at.
It is not meant to be chased,
Bargained for,
Or questioned.

If you have to wonder
Whether love is choosing you,
Then it is already telling you the answer.

And you—
You deserve the kind of love
That stands firm,
That meets you where you are,
That takes your hand and says,

"No matter what, I choose you."`

        content: `Love will find its way to you.

Love does not always arrive
When you are ready for it.
It does not knock politely,
Waiting for permission to enter.

It comes as the tide—
Gentle some days, relentless on others,
Pulling at your shores
Even when you swore you would never let it in again.

Love finds you in the quiet moments,
In laughter you didn't expect,
In the warmth of a hand reaching for yours
When you weren't looking for comfort.

It does not always come
Wrapped in the certainty you imagined.
Sometimes, it comes softly,
A whisper instead of a declaration,
A quiet presence instead of a grand entrance.

And love, real love,
Does not demand that you be unbroken to receive it.
It does not ask you to be perfect,
To be fearless,
To be anything other than who you are.

It simply arrives.
And stays.

So when love finds you,
Let it.

Let it soften the places inside you
That have turned to stone.
Let it remind you
That you were never meant to do this alone.
Let it be what it was always meant to be—

Not a storm,
But a home.`
