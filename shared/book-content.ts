        content: `You are here.

And that means something.

This book is not just a collection of words.
It is a place to rest. A place to feel.
A place where your heart will be spoken to
In ways you didn't know it needed.

It is a journey‚Äîone you do not have to rush through.
One you do not have to be ready for.

Let this book meet you exactly where you are.
Let it unfold in your hands like a quiet revelation,
Like something you have always known but never had the words for.

Because that is what words do.
They name the feelings we thought were nameless.
They light candles in the rooms we thought would always be dark.

This book is for the ones who feel too much.
For the ones who have held on for too long.
For the ones who do not know how to let go,
But are learning.

For the ones who have loved deeply,
Who have ached quietly,
Who have searched for meaning in the spaces
Where silence lingers.

You will find yourself in these pages.
Not because they will tell you who to be‚Äî
but because they will remind you of who you have always been.

Let this book be a mirror.
Let it be a hand on your back, a whisper in your ear.
Let it be a place where you no longer have to explain yourself.
Where you do not have to beg to be understood.

This is not just a book.
This is a beginning.
And I promise you‚Äî
It is a beautiful one.`

        content: `You Are a Poem, and the World is Reading You

You did not find this book by accident. It found you.

Somewhere between the pages, between the spaces of each word, there is a reflection of you. This is not just a book‚Äîit is a mirror, a conversation, a quiet whisper in the spaces you thought no one noticed.

It Is here to sit with you in your softness, to unravel you gently, to remind you that you have always been poetry in motion. It will ask you questions you didn't know you needed to answer. It will pull at the threads of your heart, not to unravel you completely, but to show you the beauty of being woven together, even after everything.

This book is not here to teach you who you are. It is here to remind you of what you already know‚Äîof the love that has shaped you, the pain that has strengthened you, and the art of being human in all its aching, beautiful forms.

You are a poem. And the world is reading you.

‚ÄìZeke Iverson.`
