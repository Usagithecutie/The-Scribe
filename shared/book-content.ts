And that means something.

This book is not just a collection of words.
It is a place to rest. A place to feel.
A place where your heart will be spoken to
In ways you didn't know it needed.

It is a journey—one you do not have to rush through.
One you do not have to be ready for.

Let this book meet you exactly where you are.
Let it unfold in your hands like a quiet revelation,
Like something you have always known but never had the words for.

Because that is what words do.
They name the feelings we thought were nameless.
They light candles in the rooms we thought would always be dark.

This book is for the ones who feel too much.
For the ones who have held on for too long.
For the ones who do not know how to let go,
But are learning.

For the ones who have loved deeply,
Who have ached quietly,
Who have searched for meaning in the spaces
Where silence lingers.

You will find yourself in these pages.
Not because they will tell you who to be—
but because they will remind you of who you have always been.

Let this book be a mirror.
Let it be a hand on your back, a whisper in your ear.
Let it be a place where you no longer have to explain yourself.
Where you do not have to beg to be understood.

This is not just a book.
This is a beginning.
And I promise you—
It is a beautiful one.`

You did not find this book by accident. It found you.

Somewhere between the pages, between the spaces of each word, there is a reflection of you. This is not just a book—it is a mirror, a conversation, a quiet whisper in the spaces you thought no one noticed.

It Is here to sit with you in your softness, to unravel you gently, to remind you that you have always been poetry in motion. It will ask you questions you didn't know you needed to answer. It will pull at the threads of your heart, not to unravel you completely, but to show you the beauty of being woven together, even after everything.

This book is not here to teach you who you are. It is here to remind you of what you already know—of the love that has shaped you, the pain that has strengthened you, and the art of being human in all its aching, beautiful forms.

You are a poem. And the world is reading you.

Not meant to be a passing storm

Leaving wreckage in its wake.

Love is the steady rain
That softens the earth,
The quiet presence
That does not demand to be seen
Yet is always felt.

Love is not just passion.
It is presence.

It is choosing—
Day after day,
Moment after moment,
To stay.

Even when the fire of newness fades,
Even when life grows heavy,
Even when the road is long
And uncertain.

Love is the hand
That reaches for yours in the dark.
The voice that says,
"You do not have to walk alone."

It is not perfect,
But it does not leave.
It does not break at the first sign of struggle.
It does not retreat when the world becomes too much.

Love stays.
Even when it is quiet.
Even when it is not easy.
Even when it has to be chosen,
Again and again.

Because love,
True love,
Is not just about feeling.
It is about being.

And it is steady,
Even when everything else is not.`

A hesitation,
A feeling that lingers in the air
But never lands.

You deserve a love
That does not flinch when the world gets heavy.
A love that does not step back
When the waters rise.
A love that does not make you wonder
If you are enough.

Because love—real love—chooses.

It chooses you in the morning light,
When your hair is messy
And your eyes are still full of dreams.
It chooses you in the midnight silence,
When your fears slip between the sheets like shadows.
It chooses you on the easy days and the impossible ones,
Not because it has to,
But because it cannot imagine a world where it does not.

Love is not meant to be guessed at.
It is not meant to be chased,
Bargained for,
Or questioned.

If you have to wonder
Whether love is choosing you,
Then it is already telling you the answer.

And you—
You deserve the kind of love
That stands firm,
That meets you where you are,
That takes your hand and says,

"No matter what, I choose you."`

Love does not always arrive
When you are ready for it.
It does not knock politely,
Waiting for permission to enter.

It comes as the tide—
Gentle some days, relentless on others,
Pulling at your shores
Even when you swore you would never let it in again.

Love finds you in the quiet moments,
In laughter you didn't expect,
In the warmth of a hand reaching for yours
When you weren't looking for comfort.

It does not always come
Wrapped in the certainty you imagined.
Sometimes, it comes softly,
A whisper instead of a declaration,
A quiet presence instead of a grand entrance.

And love, real love,
Does not demand that you be unbroken to receive it.
It does not ask you to be perfect,
To be fearless,
To be anything other than who you are.

It simply arrives.
And stays.

So when love finds you,
Let it.

Let it soften the places inside you
That have turned to stone.
Let it remind you
That you were never meant to do this alone.
Let it be what it was always meant to be—

Not a storm,
But a home.`

Love should be a place
Where your walls come down,
Where your voice does not shake,

Love should be safe.

Not perfect.
Not without its storms,
But never the storm itself.

It should be the shelter you run to,
Not the thing you run from.

It should be a hand that reaches for yours
In the dark,
A voice that says,
"I am here. I am not leaving."

Love does not ask you
To shrink yourself to be held.
It does not turn away
When your scars are visible.
It does not punish you
For feeling deeply.

It stays.
It listens.
It softens the sharp edges of the world.

And if love does not feel like safety,
If it makes you feel small,
If it makes you question the ground beneath your feet—

Love should give.

It should fill you.
It should feel like sunlight on your skin,
Not something that steals your light.
It should feel like breathing deeply,
Not gasping for air.

Love should be the kind of thing

That waters the parts of you
That have gone dry,
That reminds you that you are not too much,
That you were never too much.

Love should not leave you questioning
Whether you are worth the effort.
It should be the effort.

Because love that is real,
Love that is whole,
Does not take more than it gives.
It does not drain,
It restores.

And if love is making you feel empty,
Then it is not love.
It is longing,
It is fear,
It is something else in disguise.

Love should be the thing

That were never meant to be spoken.
You have stood in the wreckage
Of something you once called home,
Wondering if you would ever find your way back to yourself.

You are still here.

You have sat with silence so loud
It threatened to swallow you whole.
You have traced the outline of what was,
Aching for something
That no longer belongs to you.

And yet—
You are still here.

Perhaps survival does not look like victory.
Perhaps it does not feel like strength.
Perhaps it is just the quiet persistence
Of putting one foot in front of the other
When your heart is begging you to stop.

But if you are here,
If you are reading this,
If you have made it through the nights
You thought would break you—

Then know this:

You are stronger than the endings.
You are more than the love that left.
You are not just what you have lost—
You are everything that remains.

But hear me when I say: You are not running out of time.

You are growing, even when you cannot see it.
You are healing, even in the moments when it feels like you are breaking.
You are becoming—slowly, softly, and in ways that do not always feel obvious.

You are a story still unfolding,
And every page is worth reading.

Love, if it belongs to you, will never forget its way home.
It will move like the tide, pulling away only to return stronger.
It will whisper your name in the quiet spaces of the world.

You do not have to mourn what was never truly gone.

It will arrive with open hands,

Something that chooses you just as much as you choose it,
Is still on its way.

Some things are only borrowed,

Soft, fleeting, impossible to hold.

And maybe that is the lesson:
That love is not measured by its permanence,
But by the way it touched you while it was here.

Letting go does not mean erasing.
It does not mean forgetting.

It means learning to hold love differently—
Not as a weight,
Not as something to chase,
But as something that was always meant to move through you,
Not stay trapped inside of you.

🌿 Soft Guidance for Healing

💫 You do not have to force closure. Sometimes, it comes in the quiet, long after you've stopped searching for it.

💫 You do not have to make sense of everything. Some endings will always be without answers, and that, too, is a kind of peace.

💫 You do not have to feel ready to let go. Healing does not ask for your permission. It will come anyway, like the tide, like the sun rising on a life you have yet to live.

Let this be your reminder—
Release is not an ending.
It is an opening.
It is the quiet promise that something new is waiting for you.

And when you are ready,
You will walk toward it with open hands.`

If that is you—
If you have never known the warmth of unconditional love,
If you have never felt like someone's first choice,
If you have spent too many nights wondering if you were too much, or not enough—
Listen to me.

It was never your fault.
You were never too much.
You were never too difficult to love.

You were simply surrounded by those
Who did not know how to hold something as rare as you.

But you do not have to keep punishing yourself
For the way others failed to love you.

You do not have to keep proving your worth
To people who were never meant to see it.

You do not have to carry their inability to love you
As evidence that you are unlovable.

You are not unlovable.
You are not unworthy.
You are not the absence of the love you never received.

You are still here.
You are still whole.
You are still becoming.

And you are still allowed to be loved.

💫 A Whispered Reassurance

Love is not something you must earn.
Love is not something you must beg for.

It will find you in the quiet spaces,
In the hands that do not hesitate to hold yours,
In the hearts that do not ask you to become smaller to fit inside them.

Love, the kind that stays, the kind that does not make you question your worth,
Will never ask you to break yourself in order to be enough.

One day, you will understand—
You never had to chase what was already meant for you.`

Just because you do not know what comes next
Does not mean there is nothing waiting for you.

"Forget the former things; do not dwell on the past. See, I am doing a new thing! Now it springs up; do you not perceive it?"

And neither does healing.

"Cast all your anxiety on Him because He cares for you."

You were never meant to shrink just to fit inside a place

Some love was only meant to teach you something,

The waiting.
The hollow places where something used to be,

Afraid that if I set it down, I will have nowhere to go."

Dear You,

I know you have spent too long accepting love that was less than what you deserved.
I know you have mistaken attachment for connection,
Familiarity for fate,
The fear of being alone for the presence of something real.

But love—true love—is not found in the people who only stay when it is easy.
It Is not found in hands that hold you today,
But hesitate tomorrow.

Love is not a game.
It is not a chase.
It is not a battle where the one who loves less wins.

Love is showing up.
Love is being chosen without conditions.
Love is knowing that even in your darkest moments,
You will not have to face them alone.

"I have found the one whom my soul loves."
Song of Solomon 3:4

🌿 A Moment of Reflection

Have you ever mistaken longing for love?
Have you ever held onto someone, not because they were right for you,
But because they were there?

What does love look like when it is safe, when it is certain, when it does not leave?

"There is no fear in love. But perfect love drives out fear."
1 John 4:18

Love should not feel like fear.
Love should not feel like guessing.

And when you finally find it,
You will know—
Because it will never make you question if it is real.`

Only when it has nothing better to do.

Real love does not hesitate.
It does not place conditions on your worth.

It does not stand at the door with one foot outside.
It does not ask you to convince it to stay.

Dear You,

I hope you know this:
You are not meant to be loved halfway.

You are not meant to be someone's second choice,
Someone's almost,
Someone they only think about when they are lonely.

You are meant to be loved completely.
In the morning light and the midnight quiet.
In the chaos and in the calm.
In your strength and in your sorrow.

Love, when it is real, does not wait until it is convenient.
It does not come only when it is easy.
It does not disappear when life becomes difficult.

It stays.
It chooses you—every day, in every season, in every version of yourself.

And I need you to promise me something—
Do not settle for anything less than this.

"Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things."

But listen—
Love that is real will never make you beg for it.
Love that is meant for you will not make you feel like a question,

Like something to be chosen only when it is convenient.

You are not selfish for wanting to be chosen.
You are not unworthy because they could not see your worth.
You are not unlovable just because someone failed to love you well.

Love starts here.
In the way you speak to yourself.
In the way you stop chasing people who would never run for you.
In the way you trust that what is meant for you
Will always find its way to you.

"The Lord is good to those whose hope is in Him, to the one who seeks Him."
Lamentations 3:25

You were never too much.

"And now these three remain: faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love."
1 Corinthians 13:13

The love you deserve is already making its way to you.
And when it arrives, you will not have to question if it is real.`

They call it a burden, something to suppress,

But emotions are not weaknesses.
They are the language of the soul,
The quiet proof that you are alive,
The evidence that something within you is still reaching for more.

To feel deeply is not to break easily.
It is to be vast—like the ocean,
Able to hold both storms and stillness,
Both grief and wonder,
Without losing itself.

"My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever."
Psalm 73:26

💌 A Letter to You

Dear You,

I know what it feels like to be overwhelmed by what lives inside you.
To wonder if you are too much,
If the way you carry emotions like water in your hands makes you fragile.

But you are not fragile.
You are human.
And what a rare, astonishing thing it is
To be able to feel so much in a world that asks you to feel so little.

Sadness does not mean you are broken.
Longing does not mean you are lacking.
Grief does not mean you are weak.

You are simply alive.
And that, in itself, is beautiful.

"The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit."
Psalm 34:18

"Weeping may stay for the night, but rejoicing comes in the morning."
Psalm 30:5

You are not too much.
You are not too sensitive.
You are simply feeling the full spectrum of what it means to be alive.

And that is nothing to fear.`

2 Corinthians 12:9

💌 A Letter to You

Dear You,

If no one has told you this—
You do not have to be strong today.

You do not have to force yourself to smile.
You do not have to push through exhaustion just to prove your worth.
You do not have to carry everything in silence.

You are allowed to lean on others.
You are allowed to rest.
You are allowed to feel weak without believing that means you are failing.

Some days will be harder than others.
Some moments will bring you to your knees.
But even when you are at your lowest,
Even when you feel like you have nothing left to give—
You are still enough.

"The Lord is near to all who call on Him, to all who call on Him in truth."
Psalm 145:18

"Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest."
Matthew 11:28

Rest is not weakness.
Letting yourself feel is not failure.

You do not have to hold it all together.
And even if you break,
You will still be whole.`

💌 A Letter to You

Dear You,

If you are falling apart,
If you feel like you are losing pieces of yourself—
This is not your ending.

This is your becoming.

You are not broken.
You are breaking open.

Making room for something new to grow in the spaces
Where old pain used to live.

Sometimes, we have to crumble
In order to remember who we really are
Beneath all the things we thought we had to be.

And sometimes, we have to lose ourselves completely
Before we can find ourselves again.

"The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit."
Psalm 34:18

There is no timeline for healing.
There is no wrong way to fall apart.

But I promise you this—
What is being broken down in you now
Is making space for something beautiful to be built.

"But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that this all-surpassing power is from God and not from us."
2 Corinthians 4:7

I know the ache feels heavy sometimes.
I know it can feel like a weight you were never meant to carry.

But what if this ache is not your burden?
What if it is your gift?

What if it is the very thing that makes you human—
This ability to feel so deeply,
To love so completely,
To hope so fiercely,
Even when it hurts?

The ache is not your enemy.
It is your teacher.

It whispers to you about what matters.
It shows you the depth of your capacity to care.
It reminds you that you are alive.

"He has set eternity in the human heart."
Ecclesiastes 3:11

You were made to feel this deeply.
You were made to ache for more
Because more is what you were created for.

And until that more arrives,
The ache will keep you company.
It will keep your heart soft.
It will keep your soul awake.

"Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted."
Matthew 5:4

One day, the ache will be filled.
But until then,
Let it remind you of your beautiful, endless capacity to feel.`

If you are finding yourself crying at commercials, laughing at things that weren't even that funny—

This is not regression.
This is resurrection.

Your heart is coming back to life.

It means you are brave enough to be vulnerable again.
It means you trust yourself enough to love again.

"He has made everything beautiful in its time."
Ecclesiastes 3:11

Take it slow.
Be patient with yourself.
You do not have to feel everything at once.

But know this—
Your capacity to feel is your capacity to heal.
Your ability to be hurt is your ability to be loved.
Your willingness to be broken is your willingness to be whole.

"The Lord is close to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit."
Psalm 34:18

And if feeling again feels like too much,
If the emotions feel too big for your body,
Remember—
You are not fragile.
You are recovering.

And recovery looks like feeling.
Even when feeling hurts.
Especially when feeling hurts.

In a place that never quite feels like home.

Maybe it is your soul recognizing
That you were made for more
Than what this world can offer.

Still reaches for the infinite.

Ecclesiastes 3:11

The ache, the longing, the unnamed feeling—
It is your heart recognizing its true home.
It is your soul calling out
For the love that will never leave,
The peace that passes understanding,
The home that will never crumble.

"For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us an eternal glory that far outweighs them all."
2 Corinthians 4:17

The feeling you cannot name
Has a name.
It is called homesickness.
And one day, you will understand
Exactly what it was you were longing for.

"And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, 'Look! God's dwelling place is now among the people, and He will dwell with them.'"
Revelation 21:3

Until then, let the feeling be.
Let it remind you that you are more
Than what you can see.
Let it remind you that you are loved
In ways you cannot yet understand.

The unnamed feeling is holy.
It is the part of you that knows
You are headed home.`
